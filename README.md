# How It's Made
Technologies used: MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS

I built this website using the MERN stack and the MVC framework. The backend uses MongoDB for the database and ExpressJS and NodeJS for the server. The frontend of the website uses ReactJS for the user interface, Redux to manage component state, Bootstrap for styling, and Masonry for the grid layout.


# Optimizations
One of the first things I'll optimize is to add more features to the site such as visiting another user's profile and being able to leave comments.
